# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

Problem Statement
At Santander, helping customers by knowing their financial state and identifying their priorities of products is our mission.
Satisfying customers, willing customers to buy and ability of customers to pay loans are challenges.

In this project, we aim to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
